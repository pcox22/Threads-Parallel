# Threads-Parallel

The very bottom line of threads and parallel processing.
Instantiates 5 "Baby" objects that are set to "Sleep" for random amounts of time.
This time is passed to the "Thread.Sleep()" method to pause the threads for anywhere between 1 and 5000 ms.
The program simulates babies sleeping for different random amounts of time, as they would in real life, and waking up hungry, as they also tend to in real life.
